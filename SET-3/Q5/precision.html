   <h3>What is Precision?</h3>
   <p>Precision refers to a value in decimal numbers after the whole number, and it does not relate to accuracy. The concepts of accuracy and precision are almost related, and it is easy to get confused.
     Precision is a number that shows an amount of the information digits and it expresses the value of the number.</p>


    <h3>How to fix precision?</h3>
    <p>
        Using toFixed() Method, The number of decimal places in float values can be set using the toFixed() method. This method converts the number into a string, keeping the specified number of digits after the point. If no value is passed as a parameter, 
        then it takes 0 as default value i.e. no decimal points are displayed. </p>
